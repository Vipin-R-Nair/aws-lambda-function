# aws-lambda-function
a few baby steps towards node js :-)

the index.js file is a lambda function that needs to be deployed on aws. I have taken out the proprietary details in the code which can
be filled with specific endpoint details to obtain an authnz token from a service the developer is using and used that token to
call the service to obtain data .
